/**
 * The Ability class is the fundamental unit for application lifecycle scheduling. It is the base class of
 * [UIAbility]{@link @ohos.app.ability.UIAbility} and
 * [ExtensionAbility]{@link @ohos.app.ability.ExtensionAbility:ExtensionAbility}, and provides callbacks for system
 * configuration updates and memory level updates. However, you cannot inherit directly from this base class. You should
 *  opt for either [UIAbility]{@link @ohos.app.ability.UIAbility} or
 * [ExtensionAbility]{@link @ohos.app.ability.ExtensionAbility:ExtensionAbility} based on your service needs. For
 * details, see [Introduction to Ability Kit](docroot://application-models/abilitykit-overview.md).
