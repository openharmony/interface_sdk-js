/**
 * The text selection panel is an operation panel that pops up after a user selects text. This module is applicable when
 * quick operations such as translation and search need to be provided for the selected text. This helps developers 
 * quickly integrate the text selection capability and improve user interaction experience. The panel adopts a two-level
 * architecture design. The menu panel (**MENU_PANEL**) is the level-1 panel, which displays the function entries (such 
 * as translation and search) provided by the current app. The main panel (**MAIN_PANEL**) is the level-2 panel, which 
 * pops up after a user taps a function button on the menu panel and displays the specific function result. This module 
 * provides the attributes and types of the word selection panel. You can use [PanelInfo]{@link PanelInfo} to set the 
 * position and size of the panel and use [PanelType]{@link PanelType} to specify the panel type. 
 * [createPanel]{@link @ohos.selectionInput.selectionManager:selectionManager.createPanel} and 
 * [show]{@link @ohos.selectionInput.selectionManager:selectionManager.Panel.show} are used to create and display the 
 * word selection panel.
 * 
 * > **NOTE**
 * >
 * > - This module is supported only on PCs/2-in-1 devices. You can use canIUse('
 * > SystemCapability.SelectionInput.Selection') to check whether the current device supports this function.
