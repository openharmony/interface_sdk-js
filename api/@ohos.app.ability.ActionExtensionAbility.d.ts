/**
 * The ActionExtensionAbility module provides a template for you to implement custom actions. It inherits from
 * [UIExtensionAbility]{@link @ohos.app.ability.UIExtensionAbility:UIExtensionAbility}.
 *
 * By implementing ActionExtensionAbility, you can provide content viewing and processing functionalities for other
 * applications. For example, you can use ActionExtensionAbility to implement a text translation feature. Other
 * applications can then call this ActionExtensionAbility to process content that requires translation and obtain the
 * translated result.
 *
 * For details about the inheritance relationship of each ability, see
 * [Inheritance Relationship](docroot://reference/apis-ability-kit/js-apis-app-ability-ability.md#ability-inheritance-relationship)
