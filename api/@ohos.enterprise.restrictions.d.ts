/**
 * This **restrictions** module provides APIs for disallowing general features of devices. You can globally disable and
 * re-enable features such as Bluetooth, HDC, USB, Wi-Fi, cellular data, camera, and microphone.
 *
 * **Use cases**
 *
 * - In enterprise device management scenarios, administrators need to restrict functions on employee devices to prevent
 * data leaks or unauthorized use.
 * - In Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) scenarios, the enterprise space needs to restrict device functions to comply with
 * enterprise security policies.
 * - In device security control scenarios, specific functions need to be disabled to protect sensitive enterprise
 * information.
 *
 * **Problems that can be solved**
 *
 * - Prevent employees from transferring sensitive enterprise data via Bluetooth, USB, or other means.
 * - Restrict device debugging capabilities (HDC) to enhance device security.
 * - Control network access (Wi-Fi, cellular data, and so on) to comply with enterprise network policies.
 * - Manage device multimedia capabilities (camera, microphone, and so on) to protect privacy and enterprise
 * confidentiality
 *
 * **Benefits**
 *
 * - Enhance enterprise device security and reduces the risk of data leaks.
 * - Meet compliance requirements and align with security audit standards.
 * - Enable fine-grained device function control, balancing security and user experience.
 *
 * > **NOTE**
 * >
 * > The APIs of this module can be called only by a device administrator application that is enabled. For details, see
 * > [MDM Kit Development](docroot://mdm/mdm-kit-guide.md).

   *     <br>1. If the device fingerprint authentication capability has been disabled through the

   *     will throw a policy conflict.

   *     API versions earlier than 23, and on PCs/2-in-1 devices, smartphones, and tablets for API version 23 and later
   *     versions. If the device printing capability is disabled via this API, it remains disabled for specific users
   *     even if the [setDisallowedPolicy]{@link restrictions.setDisallowedPolicy} API is used to enable it for those
   *     users.
   *     <br>- **mtpClient**<sup>20+</sup>: Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) client capability (write only). Currently,
   *     this feature is supported only on PCs/2-in-1 devices. MTP allows users to linearly access media files on mobile
   *     devices. A policy conflict error will occur if this API is used to disable the MTP client capability after MTP
   *     client write has been disabled for specific users via the
   *     [setDisallowedPolicy]{@link restrictions.setDisallowedPolicy} API.
   *     <br>- **usbStorageDeviceWrite**<sup>20+</sup>: USB storage device write capability. Currently, this feature is
   *     supported only on enterprise PCs/2-in-1 devices.
   *     <br>  If the USB storage device write permission of a user is disabled via this API in any of the following
   *     situations, a policy conflict will be reported:
   *     <br>  1. The device USB capability has been disabled via the
   *     [setDisallowedPolicy]{@link restrictions.setDisallowedPolicy} API.
   *     <br>  2. USB storage device access policy has been set to read-only or disabled via the
   *     [setUsbStorageDeviceAccessPolicy]{@link @ohos.enterprise.usbManager:usbManager.setUsbStorageDeviceAccessPolicy}
   *     API.

   *     <br>- **diskRecoveryKey**<sup>20+</sup>: recovery
   *     [key export](docroot://security/UniversalKeystoreKit/huks-export-key-arkts.md) capability. Currently, this
   *     feature is supported only on PCs/2-in-1 devices.
   *     <br>- **sudo**<sup>20+</sup>: superuser do (execution with superuser privileges). Currently, this feature is
   *     supported only on PCs/2-in-1 devices. If this feature is disabled, neither enterprise spaces nor personal
   *     spaces can perform operations with superuser privileges.
   *     <br>- **distributedTransmissionOutgoing**<sup>20+</sup>: distributed one-way data transmission between devices
   *     (only data transmission to other devices is supported). A policy conflict occurs if this API is used to disable
   *     distributed one-way data transmission between devices after the distributed service has already been disabled
   *     via the [setDisallowedPolicyForAccount]{@link restrictions.setDisallowedPolicyForAccount} API.
   *     <br>- **openFileBoost**<sup>23+</sup>: file opening acceleration capability, which
   *     provides the file opening acceleration status awareness capability for apps. By integrating the corresponding
   *     APIs, apps can detect the acceleration status of files, and further implement features such as displaying
   *     unique UI identifiers for accelerated files, thereby optimizing user experience of file opening. Currently,
   *     this feature is supported only on PCs/2-in-1 devices.
   * @param { boolean } disallow - Whether to disallow the feature. The value **true** means to disallow the feature;
   *     the value **false** means the opposite.
