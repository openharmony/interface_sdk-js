/**
 * AbilityStage is a [module](docroot://quick-start/application-package-overview.md#multi-module-design-mechanism)-level
 * component manager. It is used for initializing operations such as resource preloading and thread creation at the
 * module level, as well as maintaining the application state under the module. An AbilityStage instance corresponds to
 * a module.
 *
 * When the [HAP](docroot://quick-start/hap-package.md) or [HSP](docroot://quick-start/in-app-hsp.md) of an application
 * is first loaded, an AbilityStage instance is created. If a module contains both AbilityStage and other components (
 * like UIAbility or ExtensionAbility), the AbilityStage instance is created before the other component instances.
 *
 * An AbilityStage has the lifecycle callbacks [onCreate()]{@link AbilityStage.onCreate} and
 * [onDestroy()]{@link AbilityStage.onDestroy}, and the event callbacks
 * [onAcceptWant()]{@link AbilityStage.onAcceptWant},
 * [onConfigurationUpdate()]{@link AbilityStage.onConfigurationUpdate}, and
 * [onMemoryLevel()]{@link AbilityStage.onMemoryLevel}.
