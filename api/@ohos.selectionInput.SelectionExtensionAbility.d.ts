/**
 * This module provides APIs for word selection extension, which can implement extended interactions such as searching 
 * and translating text using a mouse or touchpad. Word selection extension services can be customized by inheriting 
 * SelectionExtensionAbility. You need to declare this ExtensionAbility in the project configuration. For details, see 
 * [Developing a Word Selection Extension Ability](docroot://basic-services/selectionInput/selection-services-application-guide.md).
 * This module provides the following capabilities:
 * 
 * - Lifecycle management: Use the [onConnect]{@link SelectionExtensionAbility#onConnect} and 
 * [onDisconnect]{@link SelectionExtensionAbility#onDisconnect} callbacks to process the connection and disconnection 
 * logic.
 * - **context**: You can use **context** to call 
 * [startAbility]{@link @ohos.selectionInput.SelectionExtensionContext:SelectionExtensionContext#startAbility} to start 
 * the target ability in the same app, or use **context** as an input parameter of 
 * [createPanel]{@link @ohos.selectionInput.selectionManager:selectionManager.createPanel} to create a word selection 
 * panel.
 * 
 * > **NOTE**
 * >
 * > - This module is supported only on PCs/2-in-1 devices. You can use 
 * > **canIUse('SystemCapability.SelectionInput.Selection')** to check whether the current device supports the 
 * > capability.

   * Defines a callback triggered when the client connects to the **SelectionExtensionAbility**. You can return an RPC 
   * object in this callback to establish an IPC connection between the client and the server. You need to return a 
   * communication stub object that inherits **rpc.RemoteObject**. The system passes the stub object to the client, 
   * which then uses the stub object to communicate with the **SelectionExtensionAbility** through IPC.
   *
   * @param { Want } want - **Want** object passed by the system when the **SelectionExtensionAbility** is connected.
   *     The object contains the description information such as the ability name and bundle name. It is used to obtain
   *     the ability connection configuration in the **onConnect** callback so that the corresponding initialization
   *     logic can be executed.
   * @returns { rpc.RemoteObject } **RemoteObject** communication stub object. You need to implement the remote message
   *     processing method (for example, **onRemoteMessageRequest**) of this object. The system passes this object to
   *     the client for IPC.

   * call [destroyPanel]{@link @ohos.selectionInput.selectionManager:selectionManager.destroyPanel} to destroy the created
   * panel, or call
   * [off('selectionCompleted')]{@link @ohos.selectionInput.selectionManager:selectionManager.off(type: 'selectionCompleted', callback?: Callback<SelectionInfo>)}
   * to unsubscribe from the word selection completion event.
   *

   * in cases of abnormal disconnection (for example, process termination due to low memory conditions).
