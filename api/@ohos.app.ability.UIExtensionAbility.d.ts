/**
 * UIExtensionAbility is an ExtensionAbility component with a User Interface (UI). It inherits from
 * [ExtensionAbility]{@link ./@ohos.app.ability.ExtensionAbility:ExtensionAbility} and provides basic lifecycle
 * capabilities such as component creation, destruction, and foreground/background switching. Unlike the UIAbility, the
 * UIExtensionAbility does not appear as a separate mission in the mission view. The foreground/background state and
 * visibility of the UIExtensionAbility follow those of its host window.
 * You cannot directly inherit from the UIExtensionAbility. However, you can choose other components that inherit from
 * UIExtensionAbility based on specific service scenarios. For example, when handling data shared from other
 * applications, you can use the
 * [ShareExtensionAbility]{@link ./@ohos.app.ability.ShareExtensionAbility:ShareExtensionAbility}; when providing
 * widget editing functionality, you can use the
 * [FormEditExtensionAbility]{@link ./@ohos.app.form.FormEditExtensionAbility:FormEditExtensionAbility}.
 * For details about the inheritance relationship of each ability, see
 * [Inheritance Relationship](docroot://reference/apis-ability-kit/js-apis-app-ability-ability.md#ability-inheritance-relationship)
