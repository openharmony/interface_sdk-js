/**
 * TaskPool provides a multi-thread running environment for applications. It helps reduce resource consumption and
 * improve system performance. It also frees you from caring about the thread lifecycle. You can use the TaskPool APIs
 * to create background tasks and perform operations on them, for example, executing or canceling a task. Theoretically,
 * you can create an unlimited number of tasks, but this is not recommended due to memory limitations. In addition, you
 * are not advised performing blocking operations in a task, especially indefinite blocking. Long-time blocking
 * operations occupy worker threads and may block other task scheduling, adversely affecting your application
 * performance.
 * You can determine the execution sequence of tasks with the same priority. They are executed in the same sequence as
 * you call the task execution APIs. The default task priority is MEDIUM.
 * If the number of tasks to be executed is greater than the number of worker threads in the task pool, the task pool
 * scales out based on load balancing to minimize the waiting duration. Similarly, when the number of tasks to be
 * executed falls below the number of worker threads, the task pool scales in to reduce the number of worker threads.
 * For details about the error codes returned by TaskPool APIs, see
 * [Utils Error Codes](docroot://reference/apis-arkts/errorcode-utils.md).
 * For details about the precautions for using TaskPool, see
 * [Precautions for TaskPool](docroot://arkts-utils/taskpool-introduction.md#precautions-for-taskpool).
 * The following concepts are used in this topic:
 *
 * - Task group task: task in a [TaskGroup]{@link taskpool.TaskGroup}.
 * - Serial queue task: task in a [SequenceRunner]{@link taskpool.SequenceRunner}.
 * - Asynchronous queue task: task in an [AsyncRunner]{@link taskpool.AsyncRunner}.
 * - Periodic task: task executed by calling
 * [executePeriodically]{@link taskpool.executePeriodically(period: number, task: Task, priority?: Priority)}.
