/**
 * NotificationSubscriberExtensionAbility is the base class for notification subscriber extension abilities, providing
 * notification subscription-related functionality. Third-party wearable apps (such as companion applications for
 * watches)implement callback logic by inheriting this class, receiving notification information when notifications
 * are published on the local device and forwarding them to the wearable device via Bluetooth, and receiving callbacks
 * for notification cancellation when local notifications are cancelled and forwarding them to the wearable device to
 * delete the corresponding notifications.
 *
 * Use this module when your wearable application needs to obtain local notifications and sync them to a paired wearable
 * device. This module is used together with the notificationExtensionSubscription module. This module is responsible
 * for receiving and processing notification data in callbacks, while the notificationExtensionSubscription module is
 * responsible for management operations such as authorization, subscription, and unsubscription.
