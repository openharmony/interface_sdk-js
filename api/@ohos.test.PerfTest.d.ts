 * Represents performance metrics that can be collected by the framework.

 * > **NOTE**

 * > 1. The preceding metrics collect performance data for a specified application process, not for the system.
 * > 2. Description of collecting the CPU data (**CPU_LOAD** / **CPU_USAGE**) and memory (**MEMORY_RSS** / **MEMORY_PSS**):
 * > - During the test, the CPU and memory data of the specified application process is collected before and after the
 * >   code segment execution. Therefore, ensure that the application process to be tested exists during the test.
 * > 3. Description of collecting the application startup latency data (**APP_START_RESPONSE_TIME** / **APP_START_COMPLETE_TIME**):
 * > - Application startup latency data is affected by system log reporting. The start time is when the tap event is reported,
 * >   the end time of the response latency is when the first frame is displayed on the screen after the tap,
 * >   and the end time of the completion latency is when the first frame is displayed on the screen after the application is started.
 * >   The latency is different from what users perceive.
 * > - Application startup latency data can be collected in the following scenarios: tapping an application icon on the home screen,
 * >   tapping an application icon on the dock bar, and tapping an application icon in the application center.
 * > - During a test, only the first startup latency of the specified application is collected.
 * > 4. Description of collecting the page switching latency data (**PAGE_SWITCH_COMPLETE_TIME**):
 * > - The page switching latency calculation is affected by the system log reporting. The start time is when the tap event is reported,
 * >   and the end time is when the first frame is displayed on the screen after the page switching,
 * >   which is different from what users perceive.
 * > - Page switching latency data can be collected in the **Router** and **Navigation** components.
 * > - During a test, only the first page switching latency in the specified application is collected.
 * > 5. Description of collecting the list scrolling frame rate (**LIST_SWIPE_FPS**):
 * > - **LIST_SWIPE_FPS**: The number of frames rendered and updated on the screen per second when the list is scrolled.
 * > - Supported scenarios: list scrolling of the **List**, **Grid**, **Scroll**, and **WaterFlow** components in the ArkUI subsystem.
 * > - During a test, only the first list scrolling frame rate in the specified application is collected.
