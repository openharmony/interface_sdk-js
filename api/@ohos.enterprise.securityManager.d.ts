/**
 * This module provides enterprise device security management capabilities, including certificate management, device
 * security policy management, password policy management, clipboard policy management, watermark policy management, and

 * app clipboard, set screen and app watermarks to prevent information leakage, and implement refined management of app
 * permissions. This helps enterprises enhance device security protection capabilities and reduce data leakage risks.

   * install the re-signed app on enterprise devices where the corresponding re-signing certificate has been deployed.
   *
   * Process of using the enterprise application re-signing certificate:
   *
   * 1. Install the enterprise application re-signing certificate through the MDM application.
   * 2. Re-sign the original HAP package using a signing tool (**ohos-signer** or the DevEco Studio signing plugin).
   * 3. Install the re-signed app (through the enterprise private app store).
   * 4. Launch and run the app.
   *
   * Specifications:
   *
   * 1. Apps signed with the old certificate will continue to run normally after a new re-signing certificate is
   * installed.
   * 2. After a new enterprise signing certificate is installed for an installed enterprise app, if the installed app
   * needs to be updated, you can directly overwrite the original app without uninstalling it.
   * 3. In enterprise scenarios (especially those involving information security), enterprises need to ensure that only
   * designated internal software and tools are installed and run on employees' mobile devices. The enterprise
   * application re-signing certificate, in conjunction with the system's application management and permission control
   * mechanisms (via a unified application ID), supports silent installation of enterprise applications, controlled
   * invocation of system capabilities, and restriction of application running scopes. This enables admission control
   * and security governance for enterprise software on managed devices.
