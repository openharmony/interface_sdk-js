/**
 * ShareExtensionAbility provides extended capabilities for integrating a share details page. It inherits from 
 * [UIExtensionAbility]{@link @ohos.app.ability.UIExtensionAbility:UIExtensionAbility}.
 * 
 * By implementing ShareExtensionAbility, you can process content shared from other applications. For example, you could
 * use ShareExtensionAbility to implement the text sharing feature. When a user initiates a share action in another 
 * application, your application will appear as an option in the system share panel. Upon selection, the system 
 * activates your application to process the content and display the share detail page.
 * 
 * For details about the inheritance relationship of each ability, see 
 * [Inheritance Relationship](docroot://reference/apis-ability-kit/js-apis-app-ability-ability.md#ability-inheritance-relationship)
